# Clustering-Based-Collaborative-Filtering
This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation system using clustering algorithms to enhance the recommendation accuracy. The system employs K-means and Mean-Shift clustering techniques to group users and items, followed by collaborative filtering to predict user ratings for unseen items.
